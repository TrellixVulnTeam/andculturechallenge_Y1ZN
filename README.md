# Andculture Challenge Submission
This project was created to indicate proficiency in react, express, bootstrap, scss, and mongoose. This project was created as an alternative to [Andculture Development Challenge](https://github.com/AndcultureCode/challenge-node-react) due to technical difficulties preventing connection establishment between the react peoject and MongoDB Atlas. Despite being an alternative, this project should exhibit similar levels of proficiency of the technologies mentioned above. This project meets all the base goals of [Andculture Development Challenge](https://github.com/AndcultureCode/challenge-node-react).

## Backend Setup

The backend has its own list of dependencies that require proper function, including express, dotenv, cors, mongoose and nodemon. The pakages.json should ensure the installation of all the dependencies but if it fails, make sure the dependencies are installed. Once the dependencies are installed make sure to run
`nodemon server.js` 
to start the backend server.

## Frontend Setup

once the backend has started, you can start the frontend with `npm start`. If that fails, make sure that all the dependencies listed in packages.json are properly installed.

##
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
